# Pulse

an infinite amount of hours to spend debugging. The following list of features is meant solely to be
used as a record and does not constitute an order in which they will be implemented.

1. Album viewer.
2. Artist viewer.
3. Song player.
4. Playlist viewer.
5. Recent items container in home screen.
6. Default themes.
7. Application logo.
8. Performance optimizations.
